After delivering his second ball of the 22nd over, with Pakistan 68 for two, the Durham pace bowler pulled up with a right calf strain and left the field.An England spokesman said the 25-year-old Stokes, playing his first international match after suffering a knee injury in the first Test against Sri Lanka in May, would undergo a scan on Tuesday to determine the full extent of the injury.<br/> <br/> Later, Ali dismissed both Hafeez (42) and Younis Khan (28).Hafeez gave a simple bat/pad catch to Gary Ballance at short leg.Pakistan´s 83 for three became 102 for four when Younis, trying to loft Ali over the top, was caught at long-on.Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq also needlessly chanced his arm in hitting Ali for six. But having made a patient 52 in Pakistan´s meagre first innings 198, Misbah was unlucky to fall to Chris Woakes for 35 when he dragged a full toss onto his stumps.Pakistan were 161 for five at tea and three balls later that became 163 for six when Sarfraz Ahmed was caught down the legside by opposing wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow off Woakes.Asad Shafiq made a painstaking 39 before he was lbw to Anderson, England´s all-time leading Test wicket-taker.Yasir Shah (10), missing with a careless pull, was plumb lbw to Ali.Root took England to the brink of victory when the part-time off-spinner struck second ball to have Wahab Riaz caught off a top-edged sweep by Cook. Pakistan were then 208 for nine.Tailender Mohammad Amir delayed the inevitable with several fine shots before he holed out off Woakes.Both Anderson and Woakes took three for 41, with Ali bagging three for 88.', 'LONDON: Yasir Shah became the first leg-spinner in 20 years to take a five-wicket haul in a Test innings at Lord´s to leave Pakistan well-placed at stumps on Friday´s second day of their series opener with England.At the close, England were 253 for seven in reply to Pakistan´s first innings 339 -- a deficit of 86 runs, with Chris Woakes 31 not out.Shah, in his first Test since serving a three-month drugs ban -- and his first outside of Asia and the United Arab Emirates -- ran through England´s middle-order on the way to five for 64 in 25 overs.It was the first time any leg-spinner had taken five or more wickets in a Test innings at Lord´s since his compatriot Mushtaq Ahmed´s five for 57 in 1996.Earlier, England captain Alastair Cook made 81 and in the process surpassed India great Sunil Gavaskar as the highest run-scoring opening batsman in Test history.But, in sight of a century, he became Mohammad Amir´s first Test wicket in six years when the left-arm quick, who twice had Cook dropped, got him to play on.Amir, was making his return to Test cricket at Lord´s -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls.Amir should have had Cook out for 22 when an excellent delivery took the outside edge only for first slip Mohammad Hafeez to drop the routine catch.It was a similar story when left-hander Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed floored the seemingly simple two-handed chance.Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the 24-year-old paceman a consoling pat on the back.After the early loss of opener Alex Hales, Cook and new number three Joe Root shared a stand of 110.Cook, belying his reputation as a steady run-maker, struck three fours in four balls as Rahat Ali strayed onto the left-hander´s pads. But Shah turned the tide when he had Root carelessly hole out off a miscued sweep on 48.James Vince and the recalled Gary Ballance were both lbw as they each failed to ´pick´ Shah.Cook´s cut four off Amir took him to 61 and beyond Gavaskar´s mark of 9,607 runs as a Test opener.Amir eventually drew Cook wide and got the left-hander to play on to end a 124-ball innings featuring 12 fours.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a top-order slump in recent times.<br/> But on Friday he was deceived into playing back to Shah and bowled by a top-spinner for 29.That left England 193 for six and they were 232 for seven when, after a prolonged review, Yasir won a tight ´umpire´s call´ decision to have Moeen Ali lbw on the sweep for 23.Even before Ali´s exit had finally been confirmed, Shah had saluted his fifth wicket Friday by kissing the turf. It was the fifth time in just 13 Tests that the 30-year-old Shah had taken five or more wickets in an innings.Earlier, Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.Misbah only added four to his overnight 110 not out before he was bowled by Stuart Broad.Amir, booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four and was hit on the helmet next delivery when he ducked into another Broad ball. He was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.']"

The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.
